Design patterns:
Michael
  Command pattern: when the user enters the information for the food to be added, a command object is created
  Modal pattern: the alerts that pop up are an implementation of the modal pattern

Matt
  iterator pattern: when the program tries to authenticate the user, it creates an iterator to go through the user list
  adaptive pattern: allows the ability to choose between a color or monochrome background for the visually impaired

Erik
  active record: not implemented
  two step view: not implemented
